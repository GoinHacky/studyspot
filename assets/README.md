# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files for the Expo app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px recommended)

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:
- Online tools like https://www.appicon.co/
- Expo's asset generation tools
- Or create simple colored squares as placeholders
