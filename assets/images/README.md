This folder is for image assets used in the StudySpotter app.

Guidelines:
- Add image files here (PNG, JPG, WebP, etc.).
- Keep filenames short and kebab-cased (e.g. `red-cafe.jpg`).
- For reproducible builds, commit images to git or keep them in a separate asset server and reference by URL.

Examples:
- red-cafe.jpg
- misfits-coffee.jpg
- hero-explore.jpg

If you want, I can add an image-loading helper or optimize images automatically.
